## Telco-Churn
This is a project to predict Telco customer churn. Since I work for a telecommunications company, I thought this particular project would be an interesting analysis of customer churn.

## Hardware Requirement
This project does not require any special hardware to run. It should run fine on any modern day CPU.

## Software Requirement
This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#python)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

## Code
The code for this project is provided in the `telco-churn.ipynb` notebook file. The file `visuals.py` will also be required to draw graphs and visualize the resulting metrics.

## Data
The dataset consists of 7043 anonymized customer records provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). 

## Run
Simply launch the Jupyter Notebook software from the Anaconda software package then open the file `telco-churn.ipynb` to walk through and excute the code.
